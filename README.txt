This project was intially for the term project due at the end of ASP.NET Web Dev 1.
It has been repurposed to serve as the site for labs in ASP.NET Web Dev 2.

TODO:
    Refactor item attributes as a domain class. This will dry out the code in the views.
    Update visuals. One major piece of feedback was that the site could use some attention on the front-end.
